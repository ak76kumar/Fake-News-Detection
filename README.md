# Fake-News-Detection
Aims to develop a model that can identify and distinguish between real and fake news articles
- Tools \& technologies used: Google Colab \& Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- Used different types of data cleaning and pre-processing techniques (Using NLP)
- Classification models of ML like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic regression, Random forest
- Applied BERT
- LSTM RNN based deep learning approach
- Worked on two dataset : LIAR dataset and Fake News dataset (Both available on kaggle)
