# Fake-News-Detection
Aims to develop a model that can identify and distinguish between real and fake news articles
- Tools \& technologies used: Google Colab \& Machine Learning, explored Deep Learning method
- Used different types of data cleaning and pre-processing techniques (Using NLP)
- Classification models of ML like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic regression, Random forest
- Applied Text Feature Selection method before BERT algorithm
- LSTM RNN based deep learning approach
- Worked on two dataset : 'LIAR dataset' and 'Fake News dataset' (Both available on kaggle)
